It uses the **AdventureWorks** dataset to demonstrate a range of Power BI skills including data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visual design.

##  Author's Note

While this dashboard was developed as part of a structured course, I ensured to understand the rationale behind every design and calculation. I also plan to extend it with new perspectives like customer segmentation and profit margin analysis in the future.
